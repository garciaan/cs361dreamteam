CS361 Project B Dream Planner

A hosted version of the Dream Planner site is at dreamplanner.campuslifeohs.com. There you can find a working version of the site to use and to test with (Recommended). Otherwise, you can import the database contained in campusli_dreamplanner.sql into a local server (we are not 100% sure that the wp-config will remain the same. You may have to go through that in which case the admin account is username: admin password: cs361 :: You will also need to change the first two rows in the wp_options table to your local host. NOTE: This database is designed to run on dreamplanner.campuslifeohs.com so there will be posts that are mapped to that url. Not everything will function perfectly if attempted this way). The database contains all tables and data of the current site. 

Testing is embedded within the site. You will see TESTING PURPOSES ONLY throughout some of the site. You will also see your inputs displayed after a submission underneath forms. These are for displaying our unit testing and would not normally be included in our site.
